# desafio-MTEch-2021

Our task was to analyze a Rio de Janeiro database of 35.000 Airbnb accommodations, filtering our options according to the profile we've chosen at the start of the challenge, and finding the top5 accommodations that suited best our final client. We also needed to create a plan of tour visits aiming the best experience in Rio for our chosen profile. 
All the given profiles had their necessities, limitations, likes and dislikes, as well as their budgets, so our choices had to fulfill all requirements the best way possible in a data-driven approach.
