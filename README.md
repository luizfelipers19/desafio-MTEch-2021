# desafio-MTEch-2021

Our task was to analyze a Rio de Janeiro database of Airbnb accommodations, filtering our choices according to the profile we've chosen at the start of the challenge, and finding the accommodations that suited best our final client. We also needed to create a plan of tour visits aiming the best experience in Rio for the chosen profile.
